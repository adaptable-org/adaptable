# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The currently released version of the application is available via the
`production` branch. This will generally follow the `main` branch closely.
So while any code on `main` is well on its way to being released, `main`
may occasionally be ahead of `production`.

Any potential security issues on either of this branches should be reported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email security@adaptable.org if you find a vulnerability. You can
expect a response within 24 hours, and we'll keep you apprised as we work
towards releasing a fix.
